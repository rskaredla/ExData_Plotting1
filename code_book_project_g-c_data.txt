Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were recorded. The sensor acceleration signal, has gravitational and body motion components. The average of each variable for each activity and each subject is presented in 'out_project_g-c_data.csv'. The data are arranged in columns as in the below sequence -

1 tBodyAcc-mean-X
2 tBodyAcc-mean-Y
3 tBodyAcc-mean-Z
4 tBodyAcc-std-X
5 tBodyAcc-std-Y
6 tBodyAcc-std-Z
